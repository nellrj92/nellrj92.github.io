            My PhD project is focused on serotonergic modulation of slow oscillations in entorhinal cortex, it led to the publication 
            "Somatostatin interneurons activated by 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor suppress slow oscillations in medial entorhinal cortex (Elife, 2021)". 
            We identified a novel mechanism by which serotonin is able to alter cortical network activity. During the course of this project I employed the following techniques: 
            in vitro patch clamp, silicone probe recording in anesthetized mice, optogenetics, 
            pharmacology, immunohistochemistry and confocal imaging. I also became proficient with Matlab and Python for data analysis.

            I worked under the supervision of Nevena Milenkovic investigating temperature perception in mice, a follow-up to her work 
            "A somatosensory circuit for cooling perception in mice (Nature Neuroscience, 2014)". I have performed in vivo whole cell patch clamp recording from anesthetized mice,
            thalamic drug injections and behavioral training.

                During my lab rotation in the Brecht lab I assisted Dr. Shimpei Ishiyama in his project later published as 
                "Neural correlates of ticklishness in the rat somatosensory cortex (Science, 2016)".
                The aim of his project was to understand the neurophysiological basis of ticklishness. 
                My work was to assess if rats, like humans, have body areas more susceptible to tickling compared to others. 
                A Matlab-based system was used to record 50-kHz USVs (ultra-sonic vocalization). 
                USVs emission rate was used as a measure of ticklishness. 
                In addition to this psychophysics experiment I assisted to in vivo tetrodes recording and electrical microstimulation in S1.

                I did my internship in Professor Enrico Cherubini's lab working as an in vitro electrophysiologist. 
                My thesis focused on the cis-trans isomerase Pin1 role in excitatory synaptic signaling. 
                I recorded, using the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique, CA1 pyramidal cells in mouse brain slices 
                while stimulating the Schaﬀer collaterals and applying selective blockers of GABAA, AMPA and NMDA receptors.
                I performed post-hoc morphological reconstruction on a subset of neurons using biocytin and confocal microscopy. 
                My experiments contributed to the publication of “Pin1 Modulates the Synaptic Content of NMDA Receptors via Prolyl-Isomerization 
                of PSD-95 (Journal of Neuroscience, 2016)”
